# H Training Data

"trainingData.matrix" and "testingData.matrix" are sample files to test out if the neural network
can learn. The files are generated by the code in "generateData.cpp".
The files have 100 input neurons and 10 output neurons. The function these files describe
is "take the average of the input". First the input neurons are initialized with random values in the 
range [0.0,1.0]. Then if the average of the values of the input neurons is in the range 
[0.0,0.1], the correct output is (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). If the average is in the range [0.1,0.2],
then the correcto output is (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) ... and so on up to [0.9,1.0], (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1).

# H Parameters

The following parameters take about 40 sec to run on my laptop in Visual Studio Release mode
(CPU: AMD RYZEN 7 Mobile 3750H), and get the neural net up to 99% correct answers on the above training data:
 - hidden layers: 1
    - HL1: 50 neurons (HL1 stands for hidden layer 1)
 - initial values of weights and biases: random in the range [-0.1,0.1]
 - batch size: 10
 - generation count: 30
 - learning rate: 1.5
 - learning rate decrease after each generation: 1.2

 
The following parameters take about 3 min 40 sec to run on my laptop in VS Release, and usually get the network
up to 99.5% correct answers:
 - hidden layers: 2
   - HL1: 50
   - HL2: 50
 - initial values of weights and biases: random in the range [-0.1,0.1]
 - batch size: 10
 - generation count: 40
 - learning rate: 1.5
 - learning rate decrease after each generation: 1.2
